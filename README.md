# BookStoreApp
Standalone Book Store App written in Java

## General Info
In the context of developing a local bookstore app to be able to insert and find books in our computer, I developed this app. You can easily navigate through the books that you've already registered, search them by the author, their genre, or ISBN while also delete them. Errors for not providing valid years/ISBN were also implemented.

## Technologies
JDK 18.0.1

## Setup
To run this project, navigate to StartFunction.java file in the src/ folder and run it.
